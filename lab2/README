Lab 2
=====

This lab has us utilizing many of the macros and subroutines that Dr. Stapleton 
provided for us to use.

Compiling
=========

    $ ../asm12 -l lab2-sample.s

Should provide you with a listing file and an .s19 file that you can upload 
to the board via minicom or any other terminal emulator.
